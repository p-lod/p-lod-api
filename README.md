Implementing the api hosted a https://api.p-lod.org/ . See https://api.p-lod.org/docs for developing documentation.

Example call: https://api.p-lod.org/id/pompeii or https://api.p-lod.org/id/urn:p-lod:id:pompeii.

In general, the api returns json and uses P-LOD urns when it can. It accepts either ids - such as 'pompeii' or 'r1' - or urns.
